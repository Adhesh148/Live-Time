# Live Time

This is a web application build on a Spring boot starter with Vaadin framework with MySQL backend. 

## About
Live Time table is a simple, easy to use web application that helps users view their timetable on the fly. 
Instead of continuous back and forth communication between you, the TA, and the faculty, with scope for  miscommunications, we eliminate the middleman! Direct communication between the faculty and you and itâ€™s instant!
