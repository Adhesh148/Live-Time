# Live Timetable App

The project is created from the basic Spring-boot starter available at vaadin. 

The best way to create your own project based on this starter is [start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com/) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

## Running the Application

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If you want to run the application locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.

To run Integration Tests, execute `mvn verify -Pintegration-tests`.
